The U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific regions particularly saw a rise in gluten-free product consumption.</li></ul><h2>Shift in Consumer Preferences and Technological Advancements</h2><p>As the gluten-free trend grew, advancements in food technology allowed for the development of more sophisticated gluten-free crumbs that mimicked traditional breadcrumbs in taste and texture.
